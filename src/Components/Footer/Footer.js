              Welcome to Whats For Dinner! My name is Miguel, I am an aspiring
              Software Engineer who loves to cook. Like many others, I struggle
              to come up with any ideas for food when I get home after a long
              day. This is a respoitory of some of my favorite dishes. I hope
              they serve as some sort of inspiration for tonight.
